## Overview

Car Dashboard Simulator is an interactive AutoHotkey v2 application that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through a realistic car dashboard interface. The project simulates a modern digital dashboard with speedometer, RPM gauge, fuel level, and temperature monitoring.

Object-oriented programming concept example in AutoHotkey v2.

## Class Definition and Instantiation

The script features two main classes: `Car` and `CarGUI`, showing how to structure code around objects. Notice how the classes are instantiated:

```cpp
CarGUI()  // Creates an instance of the CarGUI class
```

This demonstrates the proper way to create objects in AHK v2 without using the "new" keyword.

## Constructor Method (__New)

The constructor method is special in AHK v2 classes. When you look at the Car class constructor:

```cpp
__New(make, model, maxSpeed) {
    this._make := make
    this._model := model
    this._maxSpeed := maxSpeed
    this._currentSpeed := 0
}
```

This shows how to initialize an object when it's created, accepting parameters and setting up initial state. The constructor runs automatically when you create a new instance.

## Private Properties

The script uses underscores to mark properties as private:

```cpp
_make := ""
_model := ""
_maxSpeed := 0
```

This is a coding convention telling other developers, "Hey, don't access these directly from outside the class." It helps with encapsulation, keeping the object's internal state protected.

## Property Getters and Setters

The script showcases different ways to create property accessors:

```cpp
// Full getter/setter pair
Make {
    get => this._make
    set => this._make := value
}

// Getter/setter with validation
MaxSpeed {
    get => this._maxSpeed
    set => this._maxSpeed := (value > 0) ? value : this._maxSpeed
}

// Read-only property using the fat arrow shorthand
RPM => this._rpm
```

These accessors control how properties are read and changed, letting you add validation or other logic when properties are accessed.

## Methods with Parameters

The `Accelerate` and `Brake` methods show how to create functions within a class that perform actions and return values:

```cpp
Accelerate(increase := 10) {
    // Implementation
    return "Current speed is " this._currentSpeed " mph."
}
```

Notice the default parameter value (`:= 10`), which makes the parameter optional.

## Method Binding

One of the trickier aspects of OOP is maintaining the correct context in callbacks. The script shows how to do this properly:

```cpp
this.brakeBtn.OnEvent("Click", this.Brake.Bind(this))
```

This ensures that when the event fires, the method runs with the correct `this` reference.

## Object Composition

The relationship between the two classes shows composition in action:

```cpp
__New() {
    this.car := Car("Rivian", "R3", 150)
    this.CreateGUI()
}
```

The `CarGUI` class creates and contains a `Car` object, demonstrating how classes can be composed of other classes.

## Event-Driven Programming

The script builds an event-driven interface:

```cpp
this.gui.OnEvent("Close", (*) => this.gui.Hide())
```

This shows how to create responsive systems that react to user actions.

## Timer Callbacks

For recurring operations, the script demonstrates proper timer setup:

```cpp
this.animTimer := ObjBindMethod(this, "AnimateDashboard")
SetTimer(this.animTimer, 50)
```

This creates a timer that calls the `AnimateDashboard` method every 50ms, ensuring the correct object context.

## Requirements

- AutoHotkey v2.1-alpha.16 or newer
- Windows 10/11 recommended for best UI rendering

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the script with AutoHotkey v2
3. Use the GAS and BRAKE buttons to control the car
4. Press ESC or click the Ã— to close the dashboard
